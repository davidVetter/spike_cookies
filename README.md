## SQL, Cookies, and Material

I setup mock tables in a test database and tested some SQL queries with joins to grab 
teams of players and get player stats. I looked into how I can use cookies to keep my live game data
during a page refresh. I brought in Material UI and used Material components for the
elements used.
